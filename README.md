# Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Dementia Classification
## A Comparative Study of Shallow CNN and Pre-trained Networks

This project presents a deep learning–based framework for automated dementia classification
using brain MRI scans. The goal is to accurately identify four clinically recognized stages:
No Impairment, Very Mild Impairment, Mild Impairment, and Moderate Impairment, enabling
early diagnosis and improved clinical decision-making.

We evaluate multiple architectures, including a custom shallow CNN and pre-trained models
such as VGG16, MobileNet, and DenseNet. The models are trained on a publicly available
Alzheimer’s MRI dataset sourced from Kaggle, with extensive preprocessing and data
augmentation applied to improve robustness and generalization.

Experimental results show that VGG16 achieves the highest classification accuracy among
the evaluated models, while MobileNet demonstrates a favorable trade-off between performance
and computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
This work highlights the potential of deep learning models as reliable, efficient, and
cost-effective tools for dementia stage classification in real-world medical settings.
